//        COMPARISON BETWEEN WHILE AND FOR LOOP.

//        1. they are surrounded by a block.
//        2. there is a condition that is being checked to see if the loop should continue.
//        3. it for iteration.



//        CONTRAST BETWEEN WHILE AND FOR LOOP.
//        1. they technically use a different method to exit.
//        2. for loop use counter to control its exit.
//        3.  while loop use sentinel to control its exit.
//        4. for loop header has the initialization, condition and increment but while only have the exit condition
//        in its header only.
