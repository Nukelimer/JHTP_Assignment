//        1. for keyword, which is what is used to denote that it is a for loop AKA counter-controlled iteration.
//        2. starting value or initialization.
//        3. condition to check to see if the loop should continue or not.
//        4. increment or decrement part which helps in making sure the loop does not run indefinitely.
//        EDIT: number is incorrect, it supposed to be loop body.
