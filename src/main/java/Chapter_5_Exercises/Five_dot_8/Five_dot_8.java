//        COMPARISON BETWEEN BREAK AND CONTINUE.

//        1.   they both control the looping flow.
//        2.   they are used inside the body / block of the iteration.
//        3.   they are used for iteration - for loop, do while and while.



//        CONTRAST BETWEEN BREAK AND CONTINUE.
//        1. they technically end the program to a different extent, break, ends the loop totally. continue just end
//        the singular iteration only.
//        2. when the break keyword is encounters the loop ends but with the, continue keyword, it checks the condition
//        and
//        continues if the iteration condition is true(or execute the increment part of the for loop if it is used in
//        a for loop before checking the condition).
