/*(protected vs. private) Some programmers prefer not to use protected access, because
they believe it breaks the encapsulation of the superclass. Discuss the relative merits of
 using protected access vs. using private access in superclasses.*/


/* 1. fields and methods reusability - when a f or m is created with a protected access modifier, it makes them
accessible in sub classes this reduces re-writing them all over again.

2. it forces you to stay in character since the extended superclass has already created a structure.

3. we can easily trace bugs since there is a structure or flow that exists.*/
