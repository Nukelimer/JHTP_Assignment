/*(What Does Each Code Snippet Do?)
a) Assume the following method call is in an overridden earnings method in a subclass:
super.earnings()
IT CALLS THE SUPER CLASSES' earnings() method.



b) Assume that the following line of code appears before a method declaration:
@Override

OVERRIDES THE SUPER CLASS'S AND ALLOWS YOU TO OVERRIDE BUT
 WITHIN THE DEFINITION CONTEXT- DO NOT MAKE OR PASS CHANGES
 THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DEFINITION OF THE SUPERCLASS METHOD.




c) Assume the following line of code appears as the first statement in a constructor’s body:
super(firstArgument, secondArgument);

CALLS THE SUPERCLASS's CONSTRUCTOR  AND PASS IN THE PARAMETERS INTO IT.
