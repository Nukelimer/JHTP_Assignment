/*
(Super) Explain two usages of the super keyword, and state some of the advantages of each
type of usage.
1. call a superclass's constructor in the subclass's constructor.
2. call a method in the subclass.

1. Advantages,
a) Instead of recreating the constructor we just call it and pass in the params.
b) it restrict us from passing params that are invalid - more, less or different type.

2. Advantages,
a) Instead of recreating the mthd we just call it with the super keyword and .themethodname() and do whatever rather
than code duplication.
