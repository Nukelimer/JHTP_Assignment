/*State whether each of the following is true or false. If a statement is false, explain why.
a) Superclass constructors are not inherited by subclasses.
 [TRUE, SUPERCLASS CONSTRUCTORS ARE NOT INHERITED BY SUB
CLASSES. IT IS ONLY IMPLIEDLY OR EXPLICITLY CALLED USING THE SUPER KEYWORD.


b) A has-a relationship is implemented via inheritance.
[FALSE, 'HAS-A' IS IMPLEMENTED BY COMPOSITION WHICH MEANS THAT
 THE CLASS HAS OR USES ANOTHER CLASS AS ITS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR ONE OR TWO FUNCTIONALITY FOR INSTANCE, NIGERIA IS IN
 AFRICA, SO ASSUMING WE WANT TO MAKE A CLASS CALLED AFRICA WITH ALL ITS COUNTRY, WHEN WE INSTANTIATES THE NIGERIA
 OBJECT, WE HAVE CREATED A 'HAS-A' RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM.



c) A Car class has an is-a relationship with the SteeringWheel and Brakes classes.[FALSE, THE  RELATIONSHIP IS ONE OF
 'HAS-A' BECAUSE IT COMPOSES THE STEERINGWHEEL AND BRAKE CLASSES BY USING THEM TO BUILD PART OF ITSELF.]



d) When a subclass redefines a superclass method by using the same signature, the subclass
is said to overload that superclass method.

[T, THIS IS USING THE @OVERRIDE ANNOTATION]

[FALSE. REDEFINING A SUPERCLASS METHOD WITH THE SAME SIGNATURE IN A SUBCLASS IS CALLED METHOD OVERRIDING.]
