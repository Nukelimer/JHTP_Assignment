      void g() {
           System.out.println("Inside method g");
           void h() {
               System.out.println("Inside method h");
           }
       }

       ANSWER
       declaring a method inside another method is not allowed but declaring it as peers is. so taking h method
       outside and using it as its peer inside the class is the solution


int sum(int x, int y) {
int result;
result = x + y;
}

 ANSWER
 missing return statement for the value. adding a return keyword and using the result variable as the value.



void f(float a); {
float a;
System.out.println(a);
}

 ANSWER
 redeclaring the same local variable "A" which has already been declared as a parameter. taking out the redeclaration
  of a: float a totally is the solution.



void product() {
int a = 6;
int b = 5;
int c = 4;
int result = a * b * c;
System.out.printf("Result is %d%n", result);
return result;
}

ANSWER
the method does not require that it should return a  value, however using the return means that we need to specify
the return type in the header or remove the return statement totally.
