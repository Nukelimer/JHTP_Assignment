/*Answer each of the following questions:
a) What does it mean to choose numbers “at random”?-> IT MEANS THAT NUMBERS ARE RANDOMLY GENERATED BETWEEN AND THERE
IS NO POSSIBILITY OF PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF THE NEXT GENERATED NUMBER.

b) Why is the nextInt method of class SecureRandom useful for simulating games of chance? -> BECAUSE IT GENERATE
FAKERANDOM NUMBERS IN A SPECIFIC RANGE WHICH IS PERFECT FOR RANDOMLY GENERATED AND UNPREDICTABLE GAMES LIKE DICE.

c) Why is it often necessary to scale or shift the values produced by a SecureRandom object? ->BECAUSE THE RANGE IS
BETWEEN 0 AND LESSER THAN 1 OF THE UPPER LIMIT. IF WE WANT TO USE A NUMBER BETWEEN 1-6 WE MUST SCALE BY ADDING TO IT
TO MEET OR FIT THE USE CASE.



d) Why is computerized simulation of real-world situations a useful technique? -> IT HELPS IN MAKING TEST OR DECISION
 THAT WILL HAVE MINIMAL CHANCES OR LESSER PRICES FOR RESEARCH AND TESTING AND EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSE WHEREBY IF IT WAS
 IN REAL LIFE THE COST WILL BE  MUCH OR THE RESOURCES WILL BE EXPENSIVE AS OPPOSED TO A SIMULATION.
