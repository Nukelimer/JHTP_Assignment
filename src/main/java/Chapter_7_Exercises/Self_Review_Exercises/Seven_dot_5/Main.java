/*Find and correct the error in each of the following program segments:
a) final int ARRAY_SIZE = 5;
   ARRAY_SIZE = 10;
When you use final, you cannot change the value of the variable. we can either  change it from "final" if we want to
reassign a new value.



b) int[] b = new int[10];
for (int i = 0; i <= b.length; i++)
b[i] = 1;

The condition makes the last iteration be out of bound as arrays are zero based. the for loop misses the opening and
curly braces and
the body
b[i]
sets all the
 10 array variables to 1.



c) int[][] a = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
a[1][1] = 5;
it's a multidimensional array so you cannot access the elements in the arrays without
comma separated. but by square brackets.
