/*
Determine whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) An array can store many different types of values.[FALSE AN ARRAY CAN ONLY TAKE THE SAME TYPE VALUES BECAUSE
TO CREATE OR INIT AN ARRAY, YOU HAVE TO DEFINE THE TYPE SO A CONFLICT OR MIXING OF TYPES, IT BECOMES AN ERROR]


b) An array index should normally be of type float.[FALSE, IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE INTEGER AS INTEGER ARE DEFINITE AND
SPECIFIC]

c) An individual array element that’s passed to a method and modified in that method will
 contain the modified value when the called method completes execution.[FALSE, IT IS DISCARDED AS THE METHODS
 COMPLETE AND THE ARRAY ELEMENT IS JUST A COPY AND NOT THE ORIGINAL ELEMENT IF IT IS A REFERENCE TYPE.]

d) Command-line arguments are separated by commas. [FALSE, COMMAND LINES ARGS ARE SEPARATED BY SPACES]
