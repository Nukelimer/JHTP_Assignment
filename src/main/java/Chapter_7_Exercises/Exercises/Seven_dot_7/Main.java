/*
Determine whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) To refer to a particular location or element within an array, we specify the name of the
array and the order of the element in the array, assuming ordering starts at position 1.
[FALSE, ARRAYS ARE ZERO BASED SO THE ORDER STARTS AT 0, BUT WE CAN ASSESS IT USING THE ARRAY'S NAME]

b) An array declaration initializes the elements in the array to the integer 0 by default. [TRUE, BOOLEAN TO FALSE
AND REFERENCE TYPES TO NULL]

c) To indicate that 200 locations should be reserved for integer array p, you write the
declaration int p[] = new int[200];[CORRECT, A DISCREET LOCATION WILL BE CREATED IN
 MEMORY FOR THE INTS AND DEFAULT
TO 0]


d) For an application that initializes the elements of a twenty-element integer array to zero,
it is preferable to use some kind of loop. [TRUE, SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR(INT I = 0; I < ARR.LENGTH; I++){
 ARR[I] = 0;
 }
 ]



e) To access all the elements in a two-dimensional array using a loop, the traversal across
rows must be done in the outer loop and the traversal across columns in the inner loop
[TRUE, THE OUTER LOOP WILL LOOP THE ROW OR THE FIRST SECTION OF THE ARRAY, THEN THE INNER
ARRAY WILL LOOP THE COLUMN.]
