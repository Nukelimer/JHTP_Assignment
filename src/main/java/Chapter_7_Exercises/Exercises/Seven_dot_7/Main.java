Determine whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
a) To refer to a particular location or element within an array, we specify the name of the
array and the order of the element in the array, assuming ordering starts at position 1.
b) An array declaration initializes the elements in the array to the integer 0 by default.
c) To indicate that 200 locations should be reserved for integer array p, you write the
declaration int p[] = new int[200];
d) For an application that initializes the elements of a twenty-element integer array to zero,
it is preferable to use some kind of loop.
e) To access all the elements in a two-dimensional array using a loop, the traversal across
rows must be done in the outer loop and the traversal across columns in the inner loop*/
